# Snake Game
The **Snake Game** is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without dying.

This version of the Snake Game is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game runs entirely in the browser and features a simple and interactive design. You control the snake's movement using arrow keys, and the game keeps track of your score based on the number of food items consumed.


## Features:
- Simple and easy-to-play controls (Arrow keys to move the snake).
- Dynamic difficulty, as the snake gets longer after eating food.
- Score tracking, which increases as the snake eats more food.
- Clean and responsive design using CSS for a smooth experience.
- Real-time game updates without needing page refreshes.
  
  The Snake Game is a great example of how JavaScript can be used to build interactive browser-based games. It showcases the use of the HTML <canvas> element for drawing graphics, as well as JavaScript for game logic, event handling, and real-time updates.
